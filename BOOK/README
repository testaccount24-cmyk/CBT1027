This application is designed to allow output to be sent to the JES2
output queue with a pre-determined destination and forms name.  This
output can then be picked up and sent to an email recipient using the
address book via the SMTP writer.

The default destination in the rexx code is EMAIL however
that can be changed.  See the DOC and SAMPLE members for information on
setting up the address book.

The member SDSFMAIL can be ran ad hoc or on an interval to pick up any
output with the destination you set up and if there is a member in the
address book that matches the form on the output queue then the information
in the address book will be used to send the output as a file to the
email addresses in the address book.  The address book can also set the
subject text as well as the ending qualifier of the dataset name.  The file
will be sent as an attachement. It will then change the destination to a
different destination to avoid it being resent as a duplicate later.  You
could also massage the code to delete the output.  SDSFMAIL is intended to be
executed as a system Rexx command from the console.  You could also set up
a timer in automation to execute it.
