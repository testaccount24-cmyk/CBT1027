I have written some code that may be of use.   It has rexx code
that can be executed via a console to system rexx, to take any
output on the JES2 output queue with a destination of EMAIL and a
form that matches a member in an address book, and email that
output as an attachment.

If you think it warrants being added to the CBT tape then you
have my permission to do so.  Also check it out to verify it can
be unzipped and received and my documentation looks good.
